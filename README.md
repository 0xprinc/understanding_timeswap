# What is TimeSwap V1
Timeswap is a 3 variable AMM-based lending and borrowing protocol which is self-sufficient, gas efficient and works without the need of oracles or liquidators.

AMM invariant model:
```
X × Y × Z = K

X = Principal Pool
​
Y = Interest Rate Pool
​
Z = Collateral Factor Pool 
​
K = Invariance Constant Product
```

[WhitePaper](https://535034581-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MIPZkDBEvwedF77USHq%2Fuploads%2FbLje2gEs6r7PrZPUoLk5%2Fwhitepaper.pdf?alt=media&token=9694e405-88a5-4fc2-a409-2b2b527413c5)

# What's different in this Repo
This Repo is a fork of the [TimeSwap-V1-Core](https://github.com/Timeswap-Labs/Timeswap-V1-Core), which is the primary repo of TimeSwap Protocol. <br> 
This Repo is an analysis of the entire codebase of that repo. <br> 
This repo has intensive comments on how is the logic and the mthematics given in their whitepaper implemented. What does each code snippet in the contract mean and why it is there.
